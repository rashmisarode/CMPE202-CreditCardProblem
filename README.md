# CMPE202-Individual-Project
individual-project-rashmisarode created by GitHub Classroom

Individual-Project part2 is included in the "individual-project-part2" folder.

## How to run the project

#### Run the following commands in top level directory, same directory as pom.xml. I have compiled the code and created executable jar in the target.
```
java -jar target/CMPE202-Indiv-Proj-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar src/main/resources/Sample.csv output/SampleOutput.csv
```


#### If you want to recompile the project then run the following command, you need to have maven installed in local. (https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
```
mvn clean install
```

#### Compilation creates the jar file name  ```CMPE202-Indiv-Proj-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` under target directory, for more help please take look at run.sh
